This is an example package for using illstack in the CAMELS Binder environment. It is a simplified version of the entire illstack package to be more user-friendly to this specific application. 


Download:

pip install --user -e .

Running:

Set base parameters in CAMELS_example/istk_params.py

The main script is generate.py. Set desired simulations (currently TNG and SIMBA available) and snapshots, then python generate.py

My organization on Binder is as follows:

Foundation scripts-
/home/jovyan/home/illstack/illstack/

Example scripts-
/home/jovyan/home/illstack/CAMELS_example/
